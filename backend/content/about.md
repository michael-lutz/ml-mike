my name is michael, but most of my friends call me lutz (my last name). i am
a quant dev in nyc, and i work on deep learning projects in my free time.
graduated from berkeley eecs, and i previously built out the core rl robotic
training framework at k-scale labs [ksim](https://github.com/kscalelabs/ksim).

i believe there's an algorithm out there that may create unbounded intelligence,
and i'd like to help find it. afterward, i'm off to build the restaurant at the
end of the universe.
